StudentId- 11259806

Task 1
Used a for loop and a logic that checked each iteration and returned a squared number
or tripled the number depending on whether it was even or not.

Task 2
Used another for loop and the toupperCase/ toLowerCase function to make sure
that all even numbers are made Uppercase and odd numbers are made lower case.
These constants and functions were saved and exported later for task 3

Task 3.
For task 3 I had to import functions and constants {processArray,formatArrayStrings, strings, num}
in order to succesfully run the code. Used another for loop with a logic that keeps adding 1 to each id.
The function then returned the id, the original names and modified names that I exported from task 2.
